<h1>Hammered Bootstrap</h1>

<p>«Hammered Bootstrap» is my clean slate kit for starting a new web project with Bootstrap 3.0 configured for processing with <a href="http://hammerformac.com">Hammer</a>. It includes the full Bootstrap 3.0 framework plus OpenSans webfont.</p>

<p>This project was designed to be able to download and drop the folder into your Hammer Projects and start building with little or no configuration needed.</p>

<h2>SCSS</h2>

<h3>variable.scss</h3>
<p>Modify _variable.scss when changing  any of the elements in the basic Bootstrap system. This file is located in /assets/css.</p>

<h3>custom.scss</h3>
<p>Use _custom.css to add any custom css to be used in defining the UI.</p>

<h2>Included Templates</h2>

<h3>Grid Template</h3>
<p>This file includes a demonstration of the basic Bootstrap grid system.</p>

<p>Note: a class called .gridColor has been defined only for the purposes of visualizing the grid system on this page. It should be removed from the code and the css for production use.</p>

<h3>Jumbotron Template</h3>
<p>This file includes a demonstration of the Bootstrap Jumbotron element. The actual jumbotron element is built as an included file in order to make it reusable in other parts of the site. The file is located in /includes.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer and Credits</h2>
<p>This project was inspired and started from the Rapid Bootstrap project by Niklaus Gerber.</p>
